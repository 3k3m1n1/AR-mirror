## Introduction
For our summer intern project, we challenged ourselves to make augmented reality more accessible, engaging, & group-friendly. The result was *Reality Check*: a prototype for room-scale AR experiences that offers seamless, body-driven interaction between people and the virtual world. Visitors are immersed via a large-format "mirror" display, rather than a headset or phone screen, and can walk around the space (or reach out and "touch" virtual objects) in order to trigger sounds, environmental changes, immersive cutscenes, and other events.

By eliminating most technical limitations, as well as AR's main barrier to entry, exhibits can now use AR to its fullest potential.

## Behind the Scenes

Reality Check is powered by the [ZED 2 stereo camera](https://www.stereolabs.com/zed-2/), which uses AI to replicate human vision.

This, combined with the [Unity game engine](https://unity.com/), offers exciting capabilities:

- Body & object detection that uniquely identifies & tracks entities, without the need for markers, bodysuits, or tracking devices
- Proper occlusion between virtual & real objects
- 3D interaction, using depth sensing & spatial triggers
- Dynamic scene elements, such as adaptive audio and lighting
- Support for large groups both indoors and outdoors, with no hard limits on capacity
